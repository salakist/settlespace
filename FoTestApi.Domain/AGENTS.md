# FoTestApi.Domain AGENTS Metadata

## Role
Pure domain layer — contains business rules and invariants for the Person aggregate.
This project has **zero infrastructure dependencies** by design.

## Folder structure
Domain uses context-first folders:
- `Auth/` — password policy, generation, and hashing services
- `Persons/` — person aggregate entities, repository contract, domain service, and person exceptions
- `Transactions/` — transaction aggregate entities, repository contract, domain service, and transaction exceptions

Function subfolders are used only when a context contains multiple function groups (for example `Entities/`, `Services/`, `Exceptions/`).

Entity naming rule: domain entities must not use an `Entity` suffix (use `Person` and `Transaction`).

## Responsibilities
- Define `Person` (aggregate root) with validation logic
- Define `Address` value object with validation logic
- Declare `IPersonRepository` repository interface
- Declare `IPersonDomainService` domain service interface
- Declare `IPasswordGenerator` password-generation interface
- Implement `PersonDomainService` (uniqueness invariant enforcement)
- Define password-related domain services for strength validation, generation, and hashing
- Raise domain exceptions (`DuplicatePersonException`, `DomainException`)
- Define `Transaction` and `TransactionStatus` with transaction invariants
- Declare `ITransactionRepository` repository interface
- Declare and implement `ITransactionDomainService`/`TransactionDomainService` for involvement and creator authorization rules
- Raise transaction-specific domain exceptions (`InvalidTransactionException`, `TransactionNotFoundException`, `UnauthorizedTransactionAccessException`)

## Domain Rules
- `FirstName` must not be null or whitespace
- `LastName` must not be null or whitespace
- `Password` is optional on creation; a random strong password is auto-generated if not provided
- Password changes are scoped to the auth flow (`/auth/change-password`), not person update routes
- `Password` provided to create/register/change-password must be at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, digit, and special character
- `PhoneNumber` is optional; when provided it must match `^(?=.*\d)[0-9+()\-.\s]{7,20}$`
- `Email` is optional; when provided it must be a valid email address
- `DateOfBirth` is optional; when provided it cannot be in the future
- `Addresses` is optional; each address requires non-empty label/street/city/country and a valid postal code
- Two persons are considered duplicates if `FirstName` and `LastName` match case-insensitively
- Duplicate checking is delegated to `IPersonDomainService.EnsureUniqueAsync`
- `Person.MatchesByFullName()` provides in-memory full-name equality for guard comparisons
- Transaction amount must be greater than zero
- Transaction currency code must be a 3-letter uppercase code (ISO style)
- `PayerPersonId` and `PayeePersonId` must be different
- Transaction description is required (max 200 chars) and category is optional (max 80 chars)
- `TransactionDateUtc` cannot be far in the future
- Transaction creator must be either payer or payee
- Create/update/get transaction operations require logged user involvement (payer or payee)
- Delete transaction operation is restricted to the creator

### Password Strength Rules (if provided)
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one special character: `!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}';:"\\|,.<>?`

### Auto-generated Passwords
- Generated when a person is created without providing a password
- Always 12+ characters
- Always contain uppercase, lowercase, digit, and special character
- Randomly shuffled to ensure security diversity

### Password Storage
- Passwords are validated as plaintext before persistence
- Persisted passwords are stored as PBKDF2 hashes rather than plaintext
- Hash verification and hash-format detection are handled by `IPasswordHashingService`
